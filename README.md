# INTRODUCTION

I was privileged to join a #datacleaningchallenge that was organized by @PromiseNonso on Twitter. This was my first cleaning project and I can say it was one of the dirtiest datasets I have seen so far.The dataset used is the FIFA-21 dataset that was gotten from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring). The challenge was to help data enthusiasts test the ability of beginners, intermediates and experts in turning the messy dataset into a clean one.
